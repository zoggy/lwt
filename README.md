Lwt provides *lightweight* (a.k.a. *cooperative* or *green*) threads for OCaml.
Normally-blocking operations can be run concurrently in a single OCaml process,
without managing system threads or locking. Lwt threads are type-disciplined and
composable â€“ Lwt is a *monad*.

Here is a simplistic program which requests the Google search page, and fails
if the request is not completed in five seconds:

```ocaml
let () =
  let request =
    let%lwt addresses = Lwt_unix.getaddrinfo "google.com" "80" [] in
    let server = (List.hd addresses).Lwt_unix.ai_addr in

    Lwt_io.(with_connection server (fun (incoming, outgoing) ->
      let%lwt () = write outgoing "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n" in
      let%lwt () = write outgoing "Connection: close\r\n\r\n" in
      let%lwt response = read incoming in
      Lwt.return (Some response)))
  in

  let timeout =
    let%lwt () = Lwt_unix.sleep 5. in
    Lwt.return None
  in

  match Lwt_main.run (Lwt.pick [request; timeout]) with
  | Some response -> print_string response
  | None -> prerr_endline "Request timed out"; exit 1
```

The above program can be compiled and run with

```
ocamlfind opt -package lwt.unix -package lwt.ppx -linkpkg -o request example.ml
./request
```
